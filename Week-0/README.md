## 📦 Installation Guide

### 🔹 Yosys – Synthesis Tool

Yosys is an open-source tool used to convert Verilog RTL (Register Transfer Level) code into gate-level netlists. It supports a wide range of synthesis targets including ASIC and FPGA flows.

**Key Features:**
- Parses and elaborates Verilog designs
- Performs logic optimization and technology mapping
- Generates netlists compatible with backend tools like OpenROAD or commercial P&R tools
- Supports formal verification and linting

**Why It’s Important:**
Yosys bridges the gap between high-level design and physical implementation. It’s the first step toward turning your Verilog into real silicon.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install yosys
```
**Check version:**
```bash
yosys -version
```

### 🔹 Icarus Verilog – Simulation Engine

Icarus Verilog (iverilog) is a compiler and simulator for Verilog HDL. It compiles your design and testbench into an executable simulation model.

**Key Features:**
- Supports behavioral and RTL-level simulation
- Generates `.vcd` (Value Change Dump) files for waveform analysis
- Compatible with GTKWave for visual debugging
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into CI workflows

**Why It’s Important:**
Simulation is critical for verifying logic before synthesis. Icarus helps catch bugs early, validate functionality, and ensure your design behaves as expected.

```bash
sudo apt install iverilog
```
**Check version:**
```bash
iverilog -v
```

### 🔹 GTKWave – Waveform Viewer

GTKWave is a graphical tool used to visualize simulation outputs. It reads `.vcd` files generated by simulators like Icarus Verilog and displays signal transitions over time.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive GUI for waveform navigation
- Supports multiple formats: `.vcd`, `.lxt`, `.fst`
- Allows zooming, signal grouping, and marker placement
- Useful for debugging timing issues and signal behavior

**Why It’s Important:**
GTKWave turns raw simulation data into visual insights. It helps you understand how signals evolve, spot glitches, and debug complex interactions.

```bash
sudo apt install gtkwave
```
**Check version:**
```bash
gtkwave -version
```
**Launch GUI:**
```bash
gtkwave
```
