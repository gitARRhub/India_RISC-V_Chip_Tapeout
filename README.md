## 📚 What I’m Learning

Each week, I explore key stages of the SoC design flow:

- ✍️ Writing modular Verilog for processor-grade IP  
- 🔍 Simulating with GTKWave and building waveform-based testbenches  
- 🧠 Synthesizing RTL using Yosys  
- 🏗️ Performing physical design with OpenLane and layout visualization in Magic  
- 📈 Documenting progress for public sharing and reproducible workflows

Even as a beginner, the structured milestones and open-source tooling make it possible to build real silicon-grade designs.

## 🌱 Why This Matters

This repository is my contribution to India’s open hardware movement.  
It reflects my commitment to:

- 🔁 Reproducible learning and workflow automation  
- 📢 Public documentation and community empowerment  
- 🧭 Strategic thinking toward scalable hardware innovation
